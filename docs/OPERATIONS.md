# Installation and recovery

## Install on Linux

Use an ordinary service account with a writable home, Python 3.10+, user systemd, and HTTPS access to GitHub release assets. Copy this kit to `/home/beads/beads-team-kit` in this example. Each deployment needs its own root, port and service name. Installation refuses unmanaged binaries or an existing service with the same name.

```sh
python3 /home/beads/beads-team-kit/admin.py --root /home/beads/beads-runtime install --port 13317 --unit beads-team.service
python3 /home/beads/beads-team-kit/admin.py --root /home/beads/beads-runtime add-project example
```

Project names use 2–24 lowercase letters/digits, starting with a letter. Run these commands as the service account. An administrator should enable its user manager at boot and after logout:

```sh
sudo loginctl enable-linger beads
loginctl show-user beads -p Linger
systemctl --user is-active beads-team.service
```

The database listens on loopback only. Its generated credential is stored in the runtime's `deployment.private.json` (0600); runtime permissions are 0700. Contributors do not need the SQL password. Do not publish this directory or open the database port on the network. The installer configures metrics off for this deployment.

If initial installation fails, it stops the service and preserves files for inspection. Do not rerun by deleting the runtime: investigate the service journal first. Repeating installation of an already initialized deployment checks its pins, port and connectivity.

## Connect a contributor

Configure the [server-owned project entry point](ONBOARDING.md) so new workers can start from an empty directory using a single SSH onboarding command. Its private instructions are included in coordination sidecar backups.

Install Python 3.10+ and OpenSSH on their machine. Configure an SSH alias `beads-team` for the server/service account with their own key; verify the server host key on first connection. Confirm an ordinary `ssh beads-team` works before using the noninteractive client.

Copy `client.example.json` to `client.local.json`, adjust the host and paths, then run:

```sh
python client.py --config client.local.json --project example --actor alex/session1 -- ready --json
python client.py --config client.local.json --project example --actor alex/session1 -- refresh
python client.py --config client.local.json --project example --actor alex/session1 -- view
```

Keep local config outside committed project content or ignored. The client transports arguments and UTF-8 file contents as JSON over SSH. It does not copy source code or run builds. `--body-file`, `--design-file`, `--file` and `-f` read files on the contributor's machine. The endpoint exposes the routine issue commands; setup and maintenance use admin.py on the host.

Copy templates/READ_ME_FIRST.md and docs/WORKFLOW.md into each project repository, fill in project details, and add links to README and AGENTS.md. This makes the entry instructions discoverable by later agents without needing a pasted chat message.

## Backups

Run after meaningful work and before maintenance:

```sh
python3 /home/beads/beads-team-kit/admin.py --root /home/beads/beads-runtime backup example
```

This invokes Beads' native Dolt backup into `runtime/backups/example`. Same-host backups protect against some mistakes, not loss of the server. Arrange an ordinary scheduled, encrypted off-machine copy of completed backups using your existing backup system. The kit does not install a backup timer. Preserve the kit/version pins and a protected copy of deployment configuration separately; JSONL views are useful exports but are not a substitute for the native backup.

Restore drills deliberately create a new project:

```sh
python3 /home/beads/beads-team-kit/admin.py --root /home/beads/beads-runtime restore-new example examplerestore
```

It refuses a populated destination, restores status and comments, and retains original issue IDs. Inspect records and comments before any cutover. Do not run both copies as live coordination trackers. A complete host-loss recovery requires reinstalling the pinned kit on a replacement host, placing the saved backup and its coordination sidecar under its backups directory, using restore-new, verifying it, then updating client project/host settings. A separate-deployment drill exercises backup transfer; actual replacement-host outage recovery remains an operator exercise.

### Coordination journals and interrupted recovery

Session registrations in `.sessions.json` are included in the coordination sidecar, alongside the private project onboarding entry point. Restore with a kit version supporting these records. Preserve original actor IDs for resumed workers; do not create a second live authority from a restored registry.

`add-project` initializes and performs an initial backup. `backup` captures both the native backup directory and `backups/PROJECT.coordination.json`. The sidecar preserves pending child-request reservations and merge context outside Dolt. Keep this pair together. A pending marker is written before synchronization and becomes complete only after native sync succeeds; restore refuses an incomplete sidecar. Backup and restore serialize access to the pair, and backup excludes contributor writes through the endpoint. Direct operator/native writes bypass these locks and must be paused for backup.

Copy a completed, quiescent backup pair off-machine using your normal encrypted backup system. Do not copy it during the next sync. This is not an atomic transaction across arbitrary filesystem copies; take a filesystem snapshot or hold the project's `backups/PROJECT.lock` while copying. Legacy backups without a sidecar warn that outstanding requests/merge context require reconciliation.

If restore is interrupted, the new destination may exist with only part of the restore completed. Preserve it for inspection; retry recovery into another unused destination. Do not delete the source or force reuse of the partially restored target. Verify pending reservations, comments, lifecycle events, baselines and slot context before switching clients.

### Optional scheduled backup

Edit `templates/beads-backup.service` for the installation paths/project, then copy it and `templates/beads-backup.timer` into the service account's `~/.config/systemd/user/`. Enable with `systemctl --user daemon-reload` and `systemctl --user enable --now beads-backup.timer`. Check `systemctl --user list-timers` and the service journal; lingering must already be enabled for unattended operation. The timer performs same-host backup only. Configure off-machine copying and retention separately. These templates do not replace an existing team's backup schedule.

### Local and Windows clients

Use `client.local.example.json` for explicit Linux same-host execution, under an account with access to the runtime. Use `beads.cmd` on Windows or `sh beads.sh` on POSIX from any directory. The wrappers take the same required config/project/actor arguments as client.py; no PowerShell execution-policy change is required. See [operational examples](OPERATIONAL_WORKFLOW.md).

Installed kit provenance is read only from the adjacent non-executable `provenance.json`
manifest. A release build must generate it after selecting the exact source revision:
`{"schema_version":1,"component":"orchestra-kit","version":"...","source_commit":"<full commit>","build_id":"<immutable build id>"}`.
Installation copies `VERSION`, `provenance.json`, and the kit files as one artifact and
must validate the manifest schema, component, version, non-empty build ID, and source
identity before use. Missing, malformed, stale, or mismatched manifests report
`source unknown`; the client never imports adjacent Python modules, consults ambient
`ORCHESTRA_SOURCE_COMMIT`, or infers identity from a parent Git checkout.

## Maintenance

```sh
python3 /home/beads/beads-team-kit/admin.py --root /home/beads/beads-runtime service status
journalctl --user -u beads-team.service -n 50
python3 /home/beads/beads-team-kit/admin.py --root /home/beads/beads-runtime service restart
```

If a client times out, inspect the task before retrying a mutation: the write may have committed. Do not replace a lost response with an assumed failure.

To retire the service, back up first, then `systemctl --user disable --now beads-team.service`. Preserve the runtime until recovery is no longer needed. Remove only the exact unit installed for that deployment and run `systemctl --user daemon-reload`. Linger is an account-wide setting: leave it enabled if other user services need it.

## Repeat validation

Local checks: `python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`.

Create two disposable projects and run the integration suite with an unused restore destination:

```sh
python tests/integration.py --config client.local.json --project testone --other-project testtwo --restore-project testrestore --output reports/local-integration.json
```

This restarts the configured server and creates synthetic records. Run it only on a disposable deployment, never a live team server. It checks two independent SSH clients, concurrent claims/comments, project separation, rendered corrections, restart and backup restoration.
