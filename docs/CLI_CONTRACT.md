# CLI compatibility contract (v1)

This document is the versioned contract between an Orchestra client (this kit's
`client.py` and its Windows/POSIX wrappers) and an endpoint. The contract identifier
is `cli-contract-v1`; `work --help` returns it in the `contract` field. The kit version
`0.1.0` implements v1. Additive fields and new optional flags keep v1; removing or
renaming a documented field, changing an ID's meaning, or changing the envelope
requires a new contract version.

The endpoint is the program that runs beside the canonical Beads service
(`endpoint.py` for SSH/local transport). Clients talk to it through one JSON envelope
and never run the native `bd` binary directly.

## Response envelope and streams

Every request is one JSON object on stdin; every response is one JSON object on stdout:

```json
{"returncode": 0, "stdout": "<the command result>", "stderr": "<diagnostics/warnings>"}
```

- `stdout` is the command result. For structured commands it is JSON text (often
  pretty-printed); for document/help commands it is text.
- `stderr` carries native warnings, progress notes and errors. It is **never** mixed
  into `stdout`.
- The client writes `stdout` to its own stdout and `stderr` to its own stderr, and
  exits with `returncode`.
- On validation or transport failure, `returncode` is nonzero (`2` for endpoint
  validation), `stdout` is empty, and `stderr` starts with the error type
  (`ValueError: ...`). Automation should parse stdout only when the exit code is `0`.

Native commands can succeed (exit `0`) while printing warnings. The endpoint forwards
those warnings on `stderr` and keeps the success JSON clean; it does not silently drop
them and does not merge them into `stdout`.

Errors are bounded and labelled. They name the offending field, index or option, but
they do not echo whole private payloads: attachment bodies, comment text and oversized
native output are not reproduced in the error or in logs.

## Command help

`work`, `review` and `handoff` answer `-h`/`--help` on stdout with exit code `0`:

```sh
b work --help
b review --help
b handoff --help
```

`work --help` returns machine-readable usage, options, limits, output shape, identity
fields and exit codes. `work --json` is accepted for consistency; `work` always returns
JSON, so the flag is a no-op. Help is data, not a `SystemExit`, so it survives the
endpoint envelope.

## `work`: list/queue shape

`work` returns:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `owner` | the actor filter that was applied, or `null` for the full queue |
| `total` | number of matching tasks in the fresh view |
| `items` | the current page, priority-sorted |
| `next_offset` | offset for the next page, or `null` |
| `coverage` | what the view covers; malformed journals add `journal_errors` |

Each `items[]` entry has `task` (the **native task ID**, e.g. `kittrial-5bb.7`),
`title`, `owner`, `status`, `review_state`, `contribution_id` (the **contribution
record's comment ID**, not a Git SHA and not `latest_comment_id`), `commit`,
`pending_review_items`, `pending_handoff_requests`, `pending_handoff_total`,
`pending_handoff_next_offset`, `lifecycle`, `lifecycle_scope`,
`lifecycle_matches_contribution` and `error`.

`show TASK --json` returns native issue rows. `comments TASK --json` returns native
comment rows. In raw rows a task's `assignee` is a plain string; in briefing/history
views identity and authorship become excerpt objects (below).

## `brief` and `history`: excerpt objects

`brief --json` and `history` intentionally bound output. Fields such as `title`,
`owner`, `author`, `intent`, `acceptance`, `depends_on_id` and `type` are **excerpt
objects**:

```json
{"text": "first 96 characters", "omitted_chars": 12}
```

`omitted_chars == 0` means the text is complete. A worker must read `.text`, not assume
a bare string; treat `omitted_chars > 0` as "read `show`/`history` for the full value".
Opaque cursor fields (`activity_cursor`, `next_cursor`) are never excerpted: they are
complete tokens.

`brief` decodes unresolved items as `open_items[]` with `id`, `kind`, `text`, `source`;
`history` pages entries with `entry_id`, `body`, `body_offset`, `body_total_chars` and
`continued`, so a long body is reassembled by concatenating fragments in offset order.

## IDs and cursor roles

- **Native task ID**: `task`/`items[].task`/the positional argument to `show`, `brief`,
  `review`, `handoff`. It is stable and is what dependencies reference.
- **Comment ID**: `contribution_id`, `contribution.comment_id`, `latest_comment_id`,
  checkpoint `comment_id`. In a `contribute`/`request-changes`/`respond`/`approve`
  payload, `contribution` is the **contribution record's comment ID** — never a Git SHA
  and never `latest_comment_id`.
- **Git commit**: `contribution.commit` / `base_commit` are exact 40- or 64-character
  hexadecimal revisions. They are not comment IDs.
- **`activity_cursor`**: identifies the current task snapshot. `brief` emits it;
  `checkpoint` requires the same task's current token. It does not continue history.
- **`next_cursor`**: continues one snapshot-bound `history` page. Omit it (and repeat
  `--since`, if used) to start a new read; it fails explicitly when its saved snapshot
  is unavailable.
- **Activity-feed cursor**: the separate project-wide novelty cursor used by
  `activity.py`.

Copy cursor tokens exactly; never retype or elide them. Display truncation surfaces as
a clear refusal, not a wrong read.

## Documented limits

| Command | Option | Range |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `work` | `--limit`, `--handoff-limit` | 1..100 |
| `work` | `--offset`, `--handoff-offset` | >= 0 |
| `work` | `--state` | one of the documented review states |
| `brief` | `--items-offset` | >= 0 |
| `brief` | `--items-limit` | 1..10 |
| `history` | `--limit` | 1..20 |
| `history` | `--body-budget` | 256..8000 encoded bytes |
| `review` | `items`/`resolutions` | 1..20 entries |
| `review` | `summary` | <= 1200 characters |
| `checkpoint` | `open_items` / `resolved` | <= 100 each |
| `checkpoint` | item `text`/`reason` | <= 400 characters |
| `checkpoint` | item `source`/`evidence` | <= 240 characters |
| `checkpoint` | whole payload | <= 80 KB canonical bytes |

Out-of-range values fail with a nonzero exit code and an error that names the option or
field **and** the limit, for example:
`open_items[0].text: expected text up to 400 characters` or
`Invalid work page: --limit and --handoff-limit must be 1..100; ...`.

## Common mistaken flags and fields

| Mistake | Correct form | Error hint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `work --review-state X` | `work --state X` | `hint: use --state for the review-state filter` |
| `work --assignee X` | `work --owner X` or `work --mine` | `hint: use --owner ACTOR or --mine` |
| `work --task X` / `work --review X` | `review X` for one task | `hint: work lists the queue; use "review TASK" for one task` |
| `--mine --owner X` | one of the two | argparse mutual-exclusion error |
| `brief --limit N` | `brief --items-limit N` | `--items-offset/--items-limit` page error |
| `previous = latest_comment_id` in a review payload | `contribution = contribution.comment_id` | review workflow names the misused ID |
| reading `brief.owner` as a string | read `brief.owner.text` | excerpt-object contract above |

## Wrapper option ordering

`beads.cmd` (Windows) and `beads.sh` (POSIX) forward their arguments unchanged to
`client.py`. Put client options before the `--` separator and the endpoint action after
it:

```sh
# POSIX
sh /path/to/kit/beads.sh --config client.local.json --project example \
  --actor alex/session1 -- work --mine --json

# Windows CMD
C:\path\to\kit\beads.cmd --config client.local.json --project example ^
  --actor alex/session1 -- work --mine --json
```

The wrappers use one interpreter: `BEADS_PYTHON` if set (one executable path, no
flags), otherwise `python` on Windows and `python3` on POSIX. Configuration and
attachment paths are resolved relative to the caller's directory unless absolute.

### PowerShell capture

Windows PowerShell `>` / `Out-File` writes UTF-16LE, not UTF-8. Do not capture client
stdout with `>` and then parse it as UTF-8:

```powershell
# Wrong: UTF-16LE file
python client.py --config client.local.json --project example --actor alex/session1 -- work --json > queue.json

# Right: let the client write UTF-8 through CMD redirection
cmd /c "python client.py --config client.local.json --project example --actor alex/session1 -- work --json > queue.json"

# Right: capture in-process and write UTF-8 explicitly
python -c "from pathlib import Path; from client import request; from requirements import load_json; r=request(load_json('client.local.json'),'example','alex/session1',[],action='view',path='issues.jsonl'); assert r['returncode']==0,r['stderr']; Path('issues.jsonl').write_text(r['stdout'],encoding='utf-8')"
```

If a UTF-16LE file already exists, decode it as `utf-16`, not `utf-8`. Passing
arguments as a literal array (`subprocess.run([...])`, or PowerShell's normal argument
passing) is supported; the client cannot detect a flag that a shell dropped before
Python started.

## `create-child` version difference

`coordinate`/`create-child` is endpoint-side: the **server kit** must be a version that
supports the `coordinate` action (this contract, `0.1.0`+). A client on a newer kit
talking to an older endpoint fails with `ValueError: Unknown action` from that endpoint;
`onboard` reports client/kit version and provenance parity so the mismatch is visible
before mutating. The native `create` call uses `--no-inherit-labels` and, for
`type=decision`, `--validate`, both of which require the pinned Beads 1.2.2. Request IDs
and content hashes are durable, so an uncertain create is reconciled with the same
request ID instead of creating a duplicate.

## Backward compatibility

Consumers should key on documented fields, tolerate additional fields, and treat any
nonzero exit code as failure. The envelope, `work` top-level shape, `brief`
excerpt-object fields, opaque cursors and the ID meanings above are stable for v1.
